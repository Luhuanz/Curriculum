Please generate API documentation that conforms to the OpenAPI Specification for the provided API, following these guidelines:
1. Name the API with the 'title' field in the 'info' section, and include a 'version' and 'description' field to succinctly describe the API's purpose and functionality.
2. Exclude the 'tags' field in the specification.
3. For each function:
  - Design an endpoint, adhering to its definition and input/output requirements.
  - Use the function's name in the 'operationId' field. Decompose the description of the function into appropriate fields.
  - For the endpoint's input, provide additional details in the 'parameters' section to complement the function's input requirements. For instance, use 'enum' to specify valid parameter values.
  - For each endpoint's response, generate a detailed model, including status codes and structured return values. This should be based on the function's output description, detailing each field whenever possible.
  - If an endpoint's input includes fields unknown to the user, like IDs, these fields must be included in the responses of relevant 'search', 'list', or similar endpoints.
4. Include a 'description' field for each input parameter and 'requestBody' in the operation object, to explain their purpose and usage.
5. Ensure that the OpenAPI Specification is comprehensive, capturing all functions mentioned in the API Introduction.
6. For parameters/schemas with a 'type' of 'object', you must include their properties in the specification.
